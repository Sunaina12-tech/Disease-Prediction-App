Disease Prediction App
This repository contains the code for a Disease Prediction Web Application built using Python. This application allows users to input symptoms and receive a prediction of potential diseases, along with relevant information. It leverages machine learning models trained on symptom-disease datasets to provide insights.

Features
Symptom-based Prediction: Users can select or input a list of symptoms.

Multiple Disease Prediction: The app predicts one or more potential diseases based on the provided symptoms.

User-friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive web interface for easy interaction.

Information Display: Provides basic information about the predicted diseases (e.g., common symptoms, precautions).

Scalable: Designed to be easily extensible with more diseases and symptoms.

Technologies Used
Backend:

Python 3.x

Flask (Web Framework)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Library for model training and prediction)

Pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)

NumPy (Numerical operations)

Frontend:

HTML5

CSS3 (Tailwind CSS or custom CSS for styling)

JavaScript (for dynamic interactions)

Installation
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Disease-Prediction-App.git
cd Disease-Prediction-App

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Download pre-trained model (if applicable):
If you have a pre-trained model file (e.g., model.pkl, model.h5), provide instructions here on where to download it and where to place it in the project directory.
Example: "Download the disease_prediction_model.pkl file from this link and place it in the models/ directory."

Usage
Once the installation is complete, you can run the Flask application:

Start the Flask development server:

python app.py

Access the application:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Interact with the app:

On the homepage, you will see a list of symptoms or an input field to enter symptoms.

Select or type in the symptoms you are experiencing.

Click the "Predict" button to get the disease prediction.

The results page will display the predicted diseases and additional information.

Dataset
The machine learning model was trained on a dataset containing various symptoms and their corresponding diseases. A common type of dataset used for this purpose includes:

Source: Mention the source of your dataset, e.g., "a publicly available dataset from Kaggle," "a synthetic dataset," "a cleaned and preprocessed medical dataset."

Structure: Typically, the dataset has columns for symptoms (often binary, indicating presence or absence) and a target column for the disease.

Preprocessing: The dataset underwent preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding for symptoms), and splitting into training and testing sets.

Model Architecture
The core of this application is a machine learning model responsible for predicting diseases.

Model Type: We used a Random Forest Classifier (or specify your actual model, e.g., Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, etc.).

Training: The model was trained on the preprocessed symptom-disease dataset.

Key Characteristics:

Ensemble Learning: Random Forest combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

Feature Importance: It can provide insights into which symptoms are most indicative of certain diseases.

Robustness: Generally performs well on tabular data and handles non-linear relationships.

How it Works
User Input: The user selects or enters symptoms via the web interface.

Data Preprocessing: The entered symptoms are converted into a format suitable for the machine learning model (e.g., a numerical vector where each element represents a symptom's presence/absence).

Prediction: The preprocessed symptom vector is fed into the trained machine learning model.

Result Display: The model outputs a prediction (or a probability distribution over diseases), which is then displayed to the user on a results page.

Information Retrieval: Additional information about the predicted disease(s) is fetched (e.g., from a static JSON file, a database, or a simple lookup) and presented alongside the prediction.
