Diabetes can be mentioned as one of the most lethal and constant sicknesses that may cause an arise in the glucose levels. Design and development of performance efficient tool is important and plays a vigorous role in initial prediction of diseases and help medical experts to start with suitable treatment or medication. Urea level may indicate kidney dysfunction, which is common in diabetic nephropathy â€“ complication of long-term poorly controlled diabetes. High Creatinine(Cr) levels are another marker of reduced kideny filtration, a condition ofthen linked to diabetes. HbA1c reflects the average blood suger level over the past 2-3 months. High level of Triglycerides (TG) are a common finding in diabetic dyslipidemia, associated with insulin resistance. Low HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and is often found in people with diabetes. High LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) contributes to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. Elevated VLDL levels are linked to an linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular events, as VLDL transports triglycerides and contributes to plaque formation. In diabetes, elevated BMI worsens complications like cardiovascular disease, kidney damage neuropathy and retinopathy. High BMI increases the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes due to insulin resistance caused by excess fat, especially visceral fat. Weight loss improves insulin sensitivity, reduces HbA1c levels and lower the risk of complications.
